# SaintsAPI
This is my final project of the WebTechnologies lecture at AIT. 

It consists in a API REST developed with JAX-RS 2.0 Jersey, Apache Tomcat and MySQL. 

On the front, jQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Make sure you run the saintdb script so you can create your database. 

The necessary jersey dependencies for the API are located in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib. (The mysql connector is also located there).
